# Project Description – Smart Weather Forecast System Using JIRA
Devagi Rajendhiran- Project Manager

This project involves the development and management of a Smart Weather Forecast System using Jira as the primary project tracking and collaboration tool. The objective of the project is to design a reliable and user-friendly weather forecasting solution that provides accurate, real-time weather information to users while ensuring efficient project planning, execution, and monitoring through agile practices.
The project focuses on collecting weather data from reliable sources, processing it using intelligent algorithms, and presenting forecasts such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, and severe weather alerts in an accessible format. JIRA is used to manage the entire software development lifecycle, including requirement tracking, sprint planning, task assignment, bug tracking, and progress monitoring.
Project activities are organized using Agile methodology, where user stories, epics, and tasks are created in JIRA to represent functional and non-functional requirements. Development progress is tracked through dashboards, sprint boards, and reports to ensure transparency, timely delivery, and continuous improvement. Regular sprint reviews and retrospectives help identify risks, resolve issues, and improve team performance.
The successful completion of this project aims to deliver an efficient smart weather forecasting application while demonstrating effective use of JIRA for project management, collaboration, and workflow optimization. The project enhances forecasting accuracy, improves user experience, and showcases structured project execution using modern software management tools.
